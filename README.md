The analysis of the living circle reflects the living utility that a place can provide for residents, which is a vital tool for planners to examine the livability of regions. However, the livability of the living place often corresponds to the high living cost, which leads to the potential spatial injustice, so compare livability with housing price is also crucial.

Based on the existing big data, this paper analyzes the spatial distribution structure of the supply of traffic, green space, business, and education in Beijing to reveal the unbalanced distribution in the city, since these variables are key data layers to the definition of ‘living circle’. This paper compares the convenience of the living circle with the housing price of each community and observes some trends of spatial injustice in Beijing to provide a reference for the further construction of the living circle of the city.
